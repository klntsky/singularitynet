import Contract.Prelude

-- This module does integration testing on state machine using purescript-quickcheck.
--
-- The idea is that, given some constraints (e.g: number of cycles of the test),
-- a value of type `StateMachineInputs` is randomly generated. This contains
-- all the interactions that the users and admin will have with the pool.
--
-- The interactions with the pools are the different commands a user/admin may
-- run. A user can either stake, withdraw or do nothing during a cycle. Whenever
-- it stakes or withdraws, it does it during the user period. The admin can
-- only deposit or close the pool. Doing nothing is not an option. Again, the
-- actions are executed in the corresponding periods.
--
-- Then, the state machine is run. Each pool cycle constitutes one transition
-- of the state machine. For each interaction in the cycle (e.g: `UserStake`) a
-- `KeyWallet -> SnetContract ()` is executed. The state of the pool at
-- the end of the cycle is then checked against a number of post-conditions
-- of type `MachineState -> MachineState -> Maybe IntegrationError`, all
-- derived from the user interactions. If no interaction throws an
-- `IntegrationError`, then the test succeeded.
